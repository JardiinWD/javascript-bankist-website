# Javascript - Bankist

This Web app simulates a landing page for the Bankist App. The application was created step by step following Jonas Schmedtmann's online bootcamp.

## **Tag head**

Inside the `head` tag there are all the links necessary for the page `style`. The links are:

- My main stylesheet.
- Link to the Poppins font taken from Google.

## **script.js**

This is my main `script file` where all the `DOM manipulations` applied to my markup reside. The whole file is divided into `regions`, in order to keep the code `cleaner and tidier`.
